## Running tips

Prover (main part is set up by Haskell and followed by Python, Elliptic Curve Digital Signature (ECDSA) is generated by Go) generated data has to be copied from output file to verifier code.

### Running Sonic Proof Generation
1. set up the repoitory. key packages:
    - galois
    - py_ecc
    - numpy, scipy, scikit-learn
    - haskell stack project builder
    
2. Run experiment-dt.py
    - setup decision tree parameters in the "setup_data" function before running the script.
    - stop the script once constraints are generated (i.e. once you see "constraints generation completed", interrupt the script).
    
3. Setup haskell scripts
    - in examples/Main.hs line 125, set inputSize = abc length
    - run "stack build"
    - run "stack exec sonic-example"
    
4. Rerun experiment-dt.py
    - if the script returns true, done!
